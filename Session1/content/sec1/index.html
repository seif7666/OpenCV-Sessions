        <h1>How image is represented</h1>
    </div>
    <span id="image_load">
        <h2>Loading an image</h2>
        <span>  To load an image, the function cv2.load is used. <strong> The second argument has the value zero which indicates that we want to read the image in gray scale format. </strong></span>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h2>Displaying an image</h2>
        <span>You can see that we can display the image using OpenCv function <strong>imshow</strong> or using Matplotlib.<br>
            Try removing the cmap arg from matplotlib and run the cell again.</span>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h2>Recognizing the image features</h2>
        <span>From running the following cells we can see that:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Image is represented as a numpy array.</li>
                <li>Image is represented as 2D matrix</li>
                <li>The datatype of the matrix is uint8 which represents integer values from <strong>0 to 255</strong></li>
            </ol>
        </span>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h2>But what does the numbers in the matrix mean?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The picture is represented as X*Y pixels.</li>
            <li>Each pixel is represented by a number.</li>
            <li>This number represents the color of the pixel.</li>
        </ol>
        <span>We will discuss the meaning of this in the following example</span>
        <p>By creating a 1D array representing numbers from 0 to 255, then converting it to a square matrix as shown in the notebook.<br>By displaying the image, we can see how the image gradually changes from black(0) to white(255).</p>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h2>Binary Image</h2>
        <span>A binary image is an image that only carries 2 values, either 255 for white or 0 for black, it can be represented as a boolean matrix</span>
    </span>
